Folder that contains raw images from the dataset to be used.

Images should be stored in a folder named 'images' as .jpg files, with all train images including 'train' in the name, all validation images including 'val' in the name, and all test images including 'test' in the name.

Ground truths should be stored in a folder named 'fixation maps', split up into folders named 'train', 'val', and 'test', as .png, with the exact same file name (other than ending) as the corresponding image.
