Folder that contains raw data from UAV123 dataset in the form of H.264 or H.265 encoded videos.

Videos should be split into the train/val/test folders as desired.

Videos should consist of the input video, followed by the ground truth/target video.
E.g. if a video sample is 100 frames long, the video stored should be 200 frames long, consisting of the 100 frames of input data followed by 100 frames of target data.
