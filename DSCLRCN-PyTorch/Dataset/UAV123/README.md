Folder that contains raw data from UAV123 dataset in the form of H.264 or H.265 encoded videos.

Videos should be split into the train/val/test folders as desired.
For each video, a video of the ground truth/target should be added to the relevant 'targets' folder.

Note that the target video must be exactly the same length as its corresponding input video, and they must match frame for frame.
