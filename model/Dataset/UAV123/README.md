Folder that contains raw data from UAV123 dataset in the form frames.

The frames for each video should be placed in a folder of that video's name in the train/val/test folder as desired.
For each video, the set of frames should be placed in a folder named 'frames', and the ground truth/target frames should be added to a folder named 'targets'.

Note that every frame must have a corresponding target frame.
